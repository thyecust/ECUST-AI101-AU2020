# p5.js

## Pre-requisite

* Get familiar with simple JavaScript code (read [this](./js) if you know Java)
* And interested in interactive apps (that's why you're here)
* Can open https://editor.p5js.org/ in your browser (as well as many documents and demos online)

## First p5.js app

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  if(mouseIsPressed){
    fill(0);
  }else{
    fill(220);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);
}
```

## p5.js Overview

Overview

* `setup` and `draw`
* mouse and touch interaction
* asynchronous calls and file loading
* browser functions and native JavaScript

### Asynchronous calls and file loading

JS is single threaded and synchronous (同步的), but you can use asynchronous (异步的) functions.

For example, if you want to draw a picture, this code will end up blank

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 240);
    let img = loadImage('cat.jpg');
    image(img, 0, 0);
}
```

Instead, you can use a callback function `drawCat` in `loadImage`

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 240);
    loadImage('cat.jpg', drawCat);
}

function drawCat(img) {
    image(img, 0, 0);
}
```

And, if you want to load large media dependencies, you should use `preload`

```js
let img;

function preload() {
    img = loadImage('cat.jpg');
}

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 240);
    image(img, 0, 0);
}
```

You can even add a loading screen

```html
<div id="p5_loading">
    this is some sweet graphics loading media dependencies
</div>
```

## About p5.js and Processing

> If you are in ECUST, you can learn Processing in *计算机动画 春* instructed by 李飞.

Processing is another popular programming language, in order to construct interactive applications, based on Java.

The main goal of p5.js is to execute Processing files in HTML5.

If you're familiar with Processing, here are some tips

* `size` is replaced by `createCanvas`
* `frameRate()` can return current frame rate, you can set it by `frameRate(num)`
* `mousePressed` is replaced by `mouseIsPressed`
* `push/popMatrix` and `push/popStyle` is replaced by `push/pop`
* the origin `(0, 0, 0)` is the center of the canvas, rather than the top-left
* there is no `PShape`
